## 1. Problem Statement

SSH services remain a frequent target of internet-scale attacks. While honeypots are commonly deployed to collect attack data, most deployments focus on **data collection rather than behavioral abstraction**.

The core problem addressed in this work is:

> How can attacker behavior be systematically abstracted from low-level SSH interaction logs generated by deception systems, in a way that supports analysis, comparison, and future automation?

---

## 2. Research Hypothesis

This work is guided by the following hypothesis:

> Structured telemetry collected from deception-based SSH honeypots contains sufficient behavioral signals to differentiate attacker intent beyond simple credential brute-forcing.

Specifically:
- Command sequences
- Timing patterns
- Authentication behavior

may collectively encode attacker objectives such as reconnaissance, environment probing, or opportunistic exploitation.

---

## 3. Why Honeypots (and Why Cowrie)

### Rationale for Deception-Based Data
- Honeypots allow **controlled exposure** of services
- All observed activity is adversarial by design
- Ground truth about defender intent is known

### Rationale for Cowrie
- Widely used and well-understood
- Produces structured JSON telemetry
- Enables reproducibility and comparison
- Suitable for low-risk, ethical experimentation

This work does **not** claim Cowrie fully represents real systems, but uses it as a **behavioral lens**, not a realism substitute.

---

## 4. Data Characteristics

### Primary Data Source
- `cowrie.json` event logs

### Key Event Types Observed
- Connection initiation
- Authentication attempts
- Session creation
- Command input events

### Extracted Features (Initial)
- Source IP address
- Username/password combinations
- Command strings
- Session duration
- Command frequency per session

These features form the basis for initial behavioral analysis.

---

## 5. Behavioral Signals of Interest

Preliminary inspection suggests several observable patterns:

### Authentication Behavior
- Repeated use of common credentials
- Sequential username variation
- Immediate disconnect after failure

### Command Behavior
- Reconnaissance-oriented commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`)
- File system probing
- Presence of automation-like repetition

### Session Structure
- Single-command sessions
- Multi-command exploratory sessions
- Idle or aborted sessions

These signals motivate deeper abstraction beyond raw counts.

## 6. Analysis Philosophy

This project intentionally prioritizes:

- **Interpretability over prediction**
- **Empirical observation over classification accuracy**
- **Behavioral abstraction over alert generation**

At this stage, the goal is **understanding**, not detection performance.

---

## 7. Limitations Identified

The following limitations are explicitly acknowledged:

- Low-interaction honeypots may constrain attacker behavior
- Attackers may fingerprint deceptive environments
- Dataset size may bias observations
- SSH-only scope limits generalization

These limitations inform future experimental design rather than invalidate findings.

---

## 8. Ethical Reflection

All experimentation adheres to ethical security research principles:

- No interaction with real users
- No active exploitation of third-party systems
- No collection of personal data
- Full isolation from production environments

The honeypot exists solely as a passive observational system.

---

## 9. Future Research Directions

Planned extensions include:

1. Session-level behavioral clustering
2. Sequence-based command modeling
3. Comparative studies across honeypot configurations
4. Integration with system observability and provenance concepts
5. Evaluation of deception fidelity versus behavioral richness

These directions aim to elevate the work from **artifact-level** to **concept-level research**.

---

## 10. Toward Publication

This document serves as the conceptual backbone for:

- A workshop paper on deception-based behavioral telemetry
- A comparative study of low-interaction honeypot observability
- Future PhD-level research on attacker behavior abstraction

The current focus is clarity, rigor, and honest interpretation—not overstated novelty.

---

## Closing Reflection

This work is intentionally framed as **research in progress**.

The primary contribution lies not in tooling, but in:
- Framing the right questions
- Understanding system-generated telemetry
- Treating attacker interaction as a behavioral signal

This mindset guides all future development.
